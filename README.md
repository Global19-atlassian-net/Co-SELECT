# Co-SELECT

The Co-SELECT pipeline uses `doit` to automate repetitive tasks of analyzing sequencing data on multiple rounds (alternatively cycles used in many of the scripts) of multiple TF experiments. It would be good to have a basic knowledge of the software, and obviously, it should be installed.

## Directory structure

The top level directory has the following subdirectories:
* `DNAShapeR` - The DNAShape program which was slightly modified for our need. Particularly we need the executable `DNAShapeR/src/dnashpe` to generate the shape values from the oligo sequences
* `src` - This subdirectory contains all the source code for Co-SELECT
* `downloads` - This subdirectory should have all the gzipped fastq files from the HT-SELECT experiments.
* `data` - This subdirectory contains all intermediate files generated by Co-SELECT. It must have enough space!
* `results` - The results of Co-SELECT are kept here.

The subdirectory `src` also contain the following files which are essential:
* `PRJEB14744_nonzero_cycle.csv` - It maps experiment TF (and barcode/primer if there are multiple experiments for the same TF) to the accession number in the project `PRJEB14744` in ENA.
* `PRJEB14744_zero_cycle.csv` - It maps the initial pool (round 0) of the experiments, multiple experiment may share the same initial pool, to the accession number in the project `PRJEB14744` in ENA.
* `tf_inventory_jolma_ronshamir.csv` - It contains all information that we could glean from the previous two literature on the dataset.
* `tf_coremotif.csv` - It gives the coremotifs that we used for the experiments. One may change the coremotif and try the whole Co-SELECT analysis.
* `tf_run_coselect.csv` - This gives the list of experiments on which Co-SELECT has to be run.

## Downloading the dataset

The example script `dodo_downloads.py` can be used for downloading all the experiments.
    > Downloading all the datasets will require 136G disk space
