# Co-SELECT

## Directory structure

The top level directory has the following subdirectories:
* `DNAShapeR` - The DNAShape program which was slightly modified for our need. Particularly we need the executable `DNAShapeR/src/dnashpe` to generate the shape values from the oligo sequences
* `src` - This subdirectory contains all the source code for Co-SELECT
* `downloads` - This subdirectory should have all the gzipped fastq files from the HT-SELECT experiments. The example script `downloads.py` can be used for downloading all the experiments.
    > Downloading all the datasets will require 136G disk space
* `data` - This subdirectory will contain all intermediate files generated by Co-SELECT. It must have enough space!
* `results` - The results of Co-SELECT are kept here.
